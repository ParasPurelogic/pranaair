      "description": "According to WHO statistics, there were an estimated 6.5 million deaths globally in 2012 from air pollution-related disorders. That amounts to 11.6% of all homicides worldwide, more than the number of deaths from tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and traffic accidents. According to a new report by the WHO, fine particles (PM2.5) kill 7 million of the global population annually. According to a paper published in the Lancet Planetary Health, air pollution causes approximately 9 million premature deaths each year, or one in every six deaths worldwide. That is why it is important to save ourselves and our loved ones from harmful air pollution."

    "paragraph2": "Many individuals believe that the only air pollutants present are dirt and smoke. The real culprit, however, is PM2.5. These are fine particulate particles about 1/13th the size of human hair. This pollutant is hazardous because it penetrates deeply into your respiratory tract, reaching your lungs, and then can enter your bloodstream, triggering a variety of health problems.",
