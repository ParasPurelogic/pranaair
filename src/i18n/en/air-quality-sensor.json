    "subtitle": "Prana Air provides low-cost air quality analyzers for particulate matters & gases, that speak durability and accuracy in volumes.",
    "description": "Air quality sensors are used in air quality monitoring devices for both indoor and ambient environments. They can detect the presence of air pollution in air. The sensors are of different types and applications. Air pollution sensors are built for specific aspects of measuring particulate matters, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, etc. In the past, the sensors were not easily affordable. Now, with the technological advancement, they become more and more affordable. The air pollution sensors have a very important role to understand and study the environmental issues."
