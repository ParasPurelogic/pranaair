Several factors control the air quality of a place. There are numerous natural, industrial, and anthropogenic sources that emit air toxins. Meteorological factors also alter and impact air quality.

Proper air monitoring helps in the formulation of an efficient action plan to mitigate air pollution.

    "description2": "The primary aspect for determining environmental stability is the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS). There are many factors that control the quality of air and many sources contributing to it such as natural, industrial and anthropogenic. Meteorological factors also alter and impact air quality. Outdoor air pollution does not just jeopardize the living. It is also detrimental to the ecology and the atmospheric chemistry of the earth. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma are examples of bad air quality for human health. Thus, outdoor air monitoring is essential. Conventionally, the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Management System (CAAQMS) used for ambient air monitoring is a very extensive and expensive set-up as it involves regular filter changes, and importing regulations. Prana Air provides ambient air quality monitors that are easy to regulations. Prana Air provides ambient air quality monitors that are easy to use, portable, and highly accurate and cost-effective. The monitors come with detecting sensors for particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and ozone based on different sensing techniques.",
