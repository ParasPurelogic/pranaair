      "description": "Ammonia (NH₃) is a colorless gas with a strong, pungent odor. It is highly toxic and can cause severe respiratory problems, skin burns, and eye damage. NH₃ is lighter than air and can accumulate in enclosed spaces. The main sources of ammonia include agricultural activities (fertilizers, livestock), industrial processes (chemical manufacturing, refrigeration), wastewater treatment plants, cleaning products, and decomposing organic matter. Proper ventilation and NH3 detection are essential for preventing ammonia poisoning in agricultural and industrial environments.",

      "title": "Electrochemical Technology",
      "description": "The NH3 sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect ammonia in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect ammonia (NH3), a toxic gas commonly found in agricultural and industrial environments. This NH3 sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When NH3 enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more NH3 in the air, the stronger the current. By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much NH3 is present. This helps in preventing ammonia exposure and keeping agricultural and industrial environments safer for workers.",
