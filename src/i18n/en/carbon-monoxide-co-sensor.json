      "description": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless toxic gas. It is produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as gasoline, natural gas, propane, coal, and wood. CO is dangerous because it binds to hemoglobin in the blood more readily than oxygen, reducing the blood's ability to carry oxygen to vital organs. The main sources of CO include vehicle exhaust, faulty heating systems, gas appliances, generators, charcoal grills, and blocked chimneys. Proper ventilation and CO detection are essential for preventing carbon monoxide poisoning.",

      "description": "The CO sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect carbon monoxide in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect carbon monoxide (CO), a deadly gas that cannot be seen or smelled. This CO sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When CO enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more CO in the air, the stronger the current. By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much CO is present. This helps in preventing carbon monoxide poisoning and keeping the air safer for everyone.",
