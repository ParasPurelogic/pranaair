      "description": "Chlorine (Cl₂) is a yellow-green gas with a strong, pungent odor. It is highly toxic and corrosive, causing severe respiratory problems, skin burns, and eye damage upon exposure. Cl₂ is heavier than air and can accumulate in low-lying areas. The main sources of chlorine include water treatment facilities, swimming pools, chemical manufacturing, bleach production, paper and textile industries, and disinfection processes. Proper ventilation and Cl2 detection are essential for preventing chlorine poisoning in industrial and water treatment environments.",

      "description": "The Cl2 sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect chlorine in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect chlorine (Cl2), a toxic gas commonly found in water treatment and industrial environments. This Cl2 sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When Cl2 enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more Cl2 in the air, the stronger the current. By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much Cl2 is present. This helps in preventing chlorine exposure and keeping water treatment and industrial environments safer for workers.",
