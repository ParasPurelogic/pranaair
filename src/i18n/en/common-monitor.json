It's not 100% accurate and given its size and price I think it would be an unrealistic expectation to have that level of accuracy. It tells you the order of magnitude of PM2.5 pollution in a place and it also indicates the measurement extremely fast. I have tested and triangulated the device output with other readings (from air purifiers) and I don't think the margin of error is beyond 10%. However, this has been at levels of PM2.5 below 100. I am not sure if the margin of error expands or reduces with the PM2.5 increases to levels beyond 150. If you wish to know, on an indicative basis, of the range of pollution in a place at a point of time, then this would be a highly recommended device."

This device has been incredibly helpful in monitoring the air quality in different rooms and alerting us when we need to take action. The readings are consistent and the device is easy to use. The battery life is also impressive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone concerned about indoor air quality, especially those with respiratory conditions."

The readings seem accurate when compared to other professional equipment. The only improvement I would suggest is making the app interface a bit more user-friendly. Otherwise, it's a solid product that delivers on its promises."
