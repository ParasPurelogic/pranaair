      "whatIsAirPollution": {
        "question": "What is air pollution?",
        "answer": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) air pollution is a major cause of disease and death in the world, contributing to 3 million premature deaths worldwide every year. It happens when gases and other substances, including particulates and biological molecules, are introduced into Earth's atmosphere, harming humans, animals, plants and the whole ecosystem. It is a global issue and a serious health concern which needs to be attended to."
      },
      "whatIsPM25": {
        "question": "What is PM2.5?",
        "answer": "PM 2.5 – or fine particulate matter – is a mixture of extremely small solid and liquid particles present in the air that are not visible to the naked eye. They measure less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which is 30 times smaller than the human hair. Because of that, they can penetrate deep into our lungs and bloodstream, causing severe damage to the lung tissue, cardiovascular disease and premature deaths."
      },
      "whatIsAQI": {
        "question": "What is AQI?",
        "answer": "An Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used by government agencies to measure the air pollution levels and communicate it to the population. As the AQI increases, it means that a large percentage of the population will experience severe adverse health effects. The measurement of the AQI requires an air monitor and an air pollutant concentration over a specified averaging period. The results are grouped into ranges, and each range is assigned a descriptor, a color code and a standardized public health advisory. You can check more about AQI here:"
      },
      "whatIsPM10": {
        "question": "What is PM10?",
        "answer": "PM10 is almost the same as PM2.5; the only difference is on it's size. PM10 measures 10 micrometers or less in diameter."
      },
      "averageAQIIndia": {
        "question": "What is the average AQI for India?",
        "answer": "The pollution sources in India – and in most Asian countries – are numerous and incompletely understood. That's why each country has to have it's own AQI values. The National Air Quality Index Standard (NAQI) in India was launched on 17 September 2014. The initiative constitutes part of the Government's mission to introduce the \"culture of cleanliness\", as the air pollution has been a huge concern in the country.\n\nLike everywhere in the world, AQI value varies on a daily bases and it depends on which city you are in. But even though India has its own AQI standards, they are ranked as one of the highest: according to the World Health Organization, 10 of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi rank among the highest levels measured in any city in the world – about 15 times higher than WHO's guideline concentrations. That's why it is very important to understand the air quality around you.",

      },
      "healthEffects": {
        "question": "How does air pollution affect people's health?",
        "answer": "Air pollution causes a huge number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), stroke, lung cancer and, of course, the worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. Symptoms like allergies, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing and asthma may lead to increased medication use, doctor visits and more hospital admissions.

      "childrenEffects": {
        "question": "How does air pollution affect children?",
        "answer": "A research done by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the youngest, the oldest and the poorest are the most vulnerable urban populations to air pollution – it affects the central nervous system, playing a role in autism, as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders. It also affects short-term memory, learning ability, impulsivity and the cognitive performance. Babies and children are particularly sensitive to the harmful effects of pollutants because they are growing and their lungs, cardiovascular system, immune system and brains are still developing."
      },
      "protection": {
        "question": "How can I protect myself from air pollution?",
        "answer": "When the AQI levels are high, the recommendation is to stay indoors and avoid doing physical activities outside, like jogging, hiking, cycling, etc., especially for sensitive groups like children, elderly and people with lung and heart conditions. If it's inevitable to go outside, an air-pollution mask should be worn. Nevertheless, indoor pollution should be taken care of. Having a good air purifier and purifying plants at home or office are recommended, and to ensure the good air quality, avoid smoking indoors and make sure that there is a chimney in the kitchen and an exhaust in the bathroom.\n\nA healthy diet rich in vitamin C, magnesium and Omega fatty acids might help to protect you from air pollution.
