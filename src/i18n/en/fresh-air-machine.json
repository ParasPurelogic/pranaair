    "description": "HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems are found in shopping malls, hotels, and hospitals, among other places. HVAC systems are mostly used for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation, as the name indicates. Although no such air filters are put within an HVAC system, it may have 1-2 filters that may filter out dust particles visible to the naked eye. However, as the rate of pollution and poor air quality rises, there is an urgent need to adopt smarter options. Dust, pollen, mold, smoke, particulate matter, pet dander, and VOCs are all filtered out by the HEPA air filtering system used in Prana Airs Fresh Air Machine. HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Absorbing Filters, and it is, as the name implies, more efficient and less expensive than typical HVAC purification systems."
