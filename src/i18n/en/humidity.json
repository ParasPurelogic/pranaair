      "title": "What Is Humidity?",
      "description": "Humidity is the term for the gaseous water content in the air. The quantity of gaseous water (water vapor) in the atmosphere is known as HUMIDITY, which can change when water is present in excess amounts. For example, when it is about to rain, there is a lot of water vapor in the air.",
      "iconAlt": "Humidity Icon"
    },
    "origin": {
      "title": "Where does Humidity come from?",
      "description": "There are many factors that decide the humidity of a place, both indoors and outdoors. Temperature plays an important role in deciding the relative humid levels indoors as well as outdoors. For example, when the temperature is hot, the humid level decreases as the air can hold more water content. But when the temperature decreases, the air cannot hold much moisture. Hence, the relative humid level increases. Therefore, when the temperature indoors is cold or hot enough, we need to warm or cool it up, respectfully, to maintain the ideal humidity levels. When there is 100% humidity in the air, it will rain as the air wont be able to hold more water vapour.",

    "moisture": {
      "title": "Are humidity and moisture the same?",
      "description": "Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the air in its gaseous state. Whereas moisture is the content of water in its liquid state. When air reaches its limit to absorb water in the form of water vapour, water will begin to condense as drops in the air that is why clouds form. That is known as moisture. When humidity reaches its peak, rainfall happens, that is moisture.",
