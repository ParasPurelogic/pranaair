It is a colorless gas, that can occur naturally in the air via various crude or natural oil sources, volcanic gases, and spring waters. Trace amounts of H₂S can be found in the atmosphere which is generally not harmful.",

      "description": "The primary target organ of hydrogen sulfide poisoning is the respiratory system. Once inhaled, hydrogen sulfide is quickly absorbed by the lungs. This may result in cardiac arrest or even death since it affects the neurological and cardiac tissues. The most well-known symptom of hydrogen sulfide poisoning is sudden death among sewage workers. All exposures to H₂S should be avoided because they have severe harmful effects.",
