    "description": "Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and non-irritating gas, therefore it cannot be detected with mere human senses. It is also likely to explode when mixed with air (limit: 12.5%∼74.2%). CO is very easy to combine with hemoglobin, which further makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to other body parts. This compromises the tissue respiration rate and even death in severe cases. CO gas has toxic effects on tissues and cells of the whole body, especially on the cerebral cortex.",
