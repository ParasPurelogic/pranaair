      "description": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a reddish-brown toxic gas with a sharp, harsh odor. It is a major air pollutant and a significant contributor to smog and acid rain. NO₂ is primarily produced during combustion processes at high temperatures, such as in vehicle engines, power plants, and industrial facilities. It can cause respiratory problems, especially in people with asthma, and can contribute to the development of respiratory infections. Long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of NO₂ may contribute to the development of asthma and potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. Vehicle emissions are the largest source of NO₂ in urban areas, particularly from diesel engines.",

      "title": "Electrochemical Technology",
      "description": "The NO2 sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect nitrogen dioxide in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful gas found in vehicle emissions and industrial processes. This NO2 sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When NO2 enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more NO2 in the air, the stronger the current. By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much NO2 is present. This helps in tracking air pollution and keeping the air cleaner and safer for everyone.",
