      "description": "Ozone (O₃) is a highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms. At ground level, ozone is a harmful air pollutant that can cause respiratory problems, chest pain, and throat irritation. It is formed when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the presence of sunlight. Ground-level ozone is a major component of smog and can worsen asthma and other respiratory conditions. However, in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere), ozone forms a protective layer that shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Sources of ground-level ozone include vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, power plants, and chemical solvents.",

      "description": "The O3 sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect ozone in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect ozone (O3), a reactive gas that can be harmful to human health. This O3 sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When O3 enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more O3 in the air, the stronger the current. By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much O3 is present. This helps in monitoring air quality and protecting people from harmful ozone exposure.",
