When students and staff are exposed to high CO2 levels, they may become drowsy, tired, and lose attention, resulting in poor academic and overall performance. The staffs thinking abilities are also hampered.",

There is a constant movement of people inside malls and shop establishments. When a few of them depart, new people enter. As a result, contaminants like carbon dioxide accumulates in malls and retail stores. Monitoring CO2 levels in the retail sector is therefore much more crucial in light of this.",

Monitoring CO2 levels is frequently overlooked when managing the hospits indoor air quality. When these levels are kept in check, recovery time and attention problems improve.",
