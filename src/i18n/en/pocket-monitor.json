        "question": "What is PM2.5, and why is it important to monitor?",
        "answer": "PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. It includes pollutants like dust, smoke, and pollutants that can be harmful to health. Monitoring PM2.5 levels is crucial because high concentrations can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems."
      },

        "number": "2",
        "question": "How does Prana Air Pocket PM2.5 monitor work?",
        "answer": "The Prana Air Pocket PM2.5 monitor uses a high-precision laser sensor to detect and measure airborne particles. The sensor counts the number of particles in different size ranges (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and calculates the concentration in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³). This data is then displayed on the LCD screen and can be transmitted via WiFi to the AQI app for remote monitoring and analysis."

The clear LCD display shows readings in real-time, with color-coded indicators for easy interpretation. Connecting to the AQI app is straightforward with the step-by-step instructions provided."
      },
      {
        "number": "4",
        "question": "Is the device portable?",
        "answer": "The Pocket PM2.5 Monitor is one of the smallest and most portable air quality monitors available. Weighing just 60 grams and measuring 5.8 x 2.5 x 4.6 cm, it fits easily in your pocket or bag. The 450 mAh battery provides 3-4 hours of continuous use, making it perfect for monitoring air quality on the go."
      },
      {
        "number": "5",
        "question": "Is there a mobile app for monitoring the data remotely?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Prana Air Pocket PM2.5 Monitor connects to the AQI mobile app (available for both iOS and Android). Through the app, you can view real-time data, historical trends, health advice based on current air quality, and monthly insights. The data is stored in the AQI cloud, allowing you to access it from anywhere at any time."
      },
