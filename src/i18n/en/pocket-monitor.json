        "question": "What is PM2.5, and why is it important to monitor?",
        "answer": "PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. It includes pollutants like dust, smoke, and pollutants that can be harmful to health. Monitoring PM2.5 levels is crucial because high concentrations can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems."
      },

        "number": "2",
        "question": "How does Prana Air Pocket PM2.5 monitor work?",
        "answer": "The Prana Air Pocket PM2.5 monitor uses a high-precision laser sensor to detect and measure airborne particles. The sensor counts the number of particles in different size ranges (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and calculates the concentration in micrograms per cubic meter (Âµg/mÂ³). This data is then displayed on the LCD screen and can be transmitted via WiFi to the AQI app for remote monitoring and analysis."
