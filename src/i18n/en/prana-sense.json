      "2": {
        "question": "2. Can I use Prana Sense in remote areas?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Prana Sense monitor can be used in remote areas as it has an option for solar panels. It can connect directly to the device without the need for a controller."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "3. What parameters can be monitored with the Dual sensor technology?",
        "answer": "Dual-sensor technology is available for Particulate Matter. It offers the continuous monitoring of PM in the air without facing any difficulty."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "4. What if both sensors data does not aligned?",
        "answer": "In dual-sensor technology, the reserve sensor works for one month to check the primary sensors working capabilities. If both sensors data is not aligned, the reserve sensor takes over and the primary sensor goes to sleep."
