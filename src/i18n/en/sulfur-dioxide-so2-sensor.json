  "calibrationSection": {
    "title": "SO2 Sensor Calibration",
    "videoAlt": "so2 sensor calibration video",
    "description": "Calibrating an SO2 sensor means checking if it gives correct readings by comparing it to a standard measurement. This is done in specific conditions: a temperature of 23°C (plus or minus 3°C), humidity of 50% (plus or minus 15%), air pressure between 0.9 and 1.1 atm, and an airspeed of 0.05 m/s. This process makes sure the sensor gives accurate and reliable results. To do this, a special gas cylinder approved by NIST (a trusted measurement standard) is used as a reference."

    "imageAlt": "sulfur dioxide molecule illustration",
    "description": "Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is a toxic gas with a strong, burnt smell. Its odor is sharp and irritating, though it is not the same as nitric acid. SO₂ is an acidic and corrosive gas. When it reacts with other substances in the air, it can form harmful compounds like sulfuric acid and sulfate pollutants, which contribute to air pollution and acid rain. The main sources of SO₂ include burning fossil fuels, power plants, metal extraction, industrial processes, volcanoes, vehicle emissions, oil refining, and diesel engines. However, the Indian government's move toward BSVI-compliant engines has helped reduce SO₂ emissions from vehicles."

  "lightModeSection": {
    "title": "What technology is being used in SO2 Sensor?",
    "imageAlt": "SO2 sensor light mode technology illustration",
    "description": "The SO2 sensor uses electrochemical gas sensing technology to detect sulfur dioxide in the air. Our monitors use a special sensor to detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), a harmful gas found in the air. This SO2 sensor works using a simple chemical process. It has two key parts called electrodes and a special material that connects them. When SO2 enters the sensor, a chemical reaction happens. This reaction creates a tiny electric current. The more SO2 in the air, the stronger the current.By measuring this current, our sensor tells us exactly how much SO2 is present. This helps in tracking air pollution and keeping the air cleaner and safer for everyone."
