      "description": "PM, Particulate matter, or Particulate is a mixture of liquid and solid particles that are suspended in the air. So, they can range from microscopic particles to particles like smoke, soot, liquid particles, and dust. And it can be seen by the naked eye. Hence, these categorized into 3 categories, based on their size. Thus, these are PM10 (coarse, visible to the naked eye), PM2.5 (fine particles), and PM1 (ultra-fine particles).",
      "aqliInfo": "According to the AQLI (Air Quality Life Index), Particulate air pollution reduces the average persons life by 2.2 years, which is more than deadly infectious illnesses like HIV/AIDS and TB, cigarette smoking, or even war. Some parts of the world more affected than others. For instance, in the U.S.A, where pollution is lower, life expectancy is reduced by only 0.1 years, compared to the WHO standard. In China and India, where pollution levels are significantly higher. Hence, the lowering particle concentrations to the WHO limit would enhance life expectancy by 2.6 and 5.9 years, respectively."

As, many other air pollutants together form the broad category of air pollution. These pollutants include Carbon monoxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen oxides, Carbon Dioxide, etc. Hence, PM is nothing but a measure to measure air pollution along with other air pollutants.",

Since, they are generated indirectly when gases emitted by burning fuels combine with sunlight and water vapor.

But, if the quantity reaches or exceeds 35 μg/m3 in 24 hours, the air is classified as hazardous. Hence, it might create problems for persons who already have breathing problems, such as asthma. Moreover, prolonged exposure to levels exceeding 50 μg/m3 can result in major health problems and untimely death."
