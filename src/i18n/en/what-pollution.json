        "description": "High levels of air pollution indicate that the air is heavily contaminated. Thus, it can hurt people more severely. Low air pollution levels imply few health risks. But How do we determine if air pollution is high or low? By calculating the average air pollution concentration over a standard time, we can determine the quality of the air. It is divided into six categories depending upon the level of harm they can do and this index is known as the Air Quality Index (AQI). Hence, we can determine the quality of the air around us with the use of this index. For example, an AQI value of 45 is considered good but AQI levels above 300 represent hazardous air quality.",
