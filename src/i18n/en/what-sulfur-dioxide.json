      "description": "Sulfur Dioxide is a gaseous form of air pollution, made from two components- sulfur and oxygen. This forms when sulfur-rich fuels burn such as oil, diesel, or coal. Sulfur dioxide already exists in the air composition but due to its various natural and man-made sources, the SO2 concentration can rise, resulting in severe effects on humans, plants, and the entire ecosystem."

        "imageAlt": "Volcanic eruption emitting sulfur dioxide",
        "description": "–Volcanic eruption is one of the many natural causes of sulfur oxides. As molten lava rises to the surface, the pressure on the magma decreases, causing dissolved sulfur and other volatile components to combine to produce various new gases. Volcano eruptions emit sulfides that can travel upwards in the stratosphere and combines with water particles that cause acid rain."

        "description": "– Fossil fuels and especially the ones with a low filtration process have a high volume of sulfur in it which helps in the formation of many sulfur oxides. The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, diesel, and other elements that contain sulfur emits sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere."

Internal combustion engines, especially diesel engines are the major sources of sulfur dioxide production in urban areas. Indian governments push for BSVI engines has made a significant impact on pollution as a whole."

    "atmosphere": {
      "title": "SO₂ in the Atmosphere",
      "description": "Sulfur Oxides are present in the atmosphere at low concentrations. Most of it is by human activities including the burning of fuel and essentially ship fuel as it has a high concentration of sulfur. In urban areas, a high concentration of sulfur oxides is detected. The life of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is less than a week during which it reacts with other atmospheric pollutants and forms various different compounds. When SO2 reacts with the oxygen present in the environment, it forms sulfur trioxide which dissolves with water vapor and forms sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a major acid rain component. It forms secondary pollutants like smog and particulate matter after attaching itself to dust particles which is quite harmful to the health and environment.",

Its short health impact can be felt quickly but the long-term impacts are very dangerous even to the extent of reduced lung capacity. It results in difficulty in breathing and tightening of airways. People with comorbidities are at high risk as it can aggravate those conditions to a point of no return.",
